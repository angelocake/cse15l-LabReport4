For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), 
take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get 
to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them 
  in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands 
  you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.
